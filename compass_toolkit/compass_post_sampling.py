    DISTR, a vector of two variables. The [1 0] means there is only normal
    observation/s, [0 1] means there is only binary observation/s, and [1 1]

    Uk: is a matrix of size KxS1 - K is the length of observation - input to
    State model - X(k)=A*X(k-1)+B*Uk+Wk
    In: is a matrix of size KxS3 - K is the length of observation - input to Normal observation model
    Yn(k)=(C.*MCk)*X(k)+(D.*MDk)*In+Vk       - C and D are free parameters,
    and MCk and MDk are input dependent components
    Ib: is a matrix of size KxS5 - K is the length of observation - input to Binary observation model
     P(Yb(k)==1)=sigmoid((E.*MEk)*X(k)+(F.*MFk)*Ib       - E and F are free parameters,

    normal observation
    Yb: is a matrix of size KxN  - K is the length of observation, matrix of
    binary observation
    Param: it keeps the model information, and parameters
