# COMPASS Toolkit
You can perform state and parameter estimation using the compass toolkit. The toolkit is developed for behaviour data (considering underlying distribution - normal & gamma) see [datasheet](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00957/full#supplementary-material) for more details in regards to usage. If you are interested in learning about the overall setup please refer [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00957/full?report=reader#h12).
